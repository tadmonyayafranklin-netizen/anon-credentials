# anon-credentials

Anonymous digital credentials that allow a user to prove possession of an attribute that has been asserted by an identity issuer without revealing any extra information about themselves. For example, a user who has received a digital passport credential can prove their “age is > 18” without revealing any other attributes.

Written in Rust.

## Overview

anon-credentials implements primitives and protocols for issuing, holding, and verifying anonymous credentials. The goal is to enable privacy-preserving proofs about attributes (range predicates, set membership, boolean properties, etc.) without unnecessarily revealing other credential data.

This repository focuses on:
- Compact credential representations
- Selective disclosure and zero-knowledge proof-friendly operations
- Practical APIs for issuers, holders, and verifiers
- Rust-first implementation suitable for native and WASM targets

## Key concepts

- Issuer — Entity that issues signed credentials containing attributes about a subject.
- Holder — The credential owner who stores credentials and constructs zero-knowledge presentations.
- Verifier — Entity that receives and verifies presentations to check predicates without learning extraneous data.
- Credential — An issued object containing attributes and cryptographic proof (signature) from the issuer.
- Presentation / Proof — A derived artifact generated by a holder that attests to requested predicates over credential attributes without revealing unrelated data.

## Features

- Core primitives for credential issuance and verification
- Selective disclosure (reveal only requested attributes)
- Support for proving predicates (e.g., "age &gt; 18") without revealing raw values
- Rust-native API with an eye to compiling to WASM for browser/edge usage
- Test-suite and examples demonstrating common flows
- Extensible design to support multiple signature schemes and ZK constructions

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (stable) — install from https://rustup.rs
- Cargo (comes with rustup)
- Optional: wasm32 target for building WASM artifacts
  - Install with: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`

### Building from source

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tadmonyayafranklin-netizen/anon-credentials.git
cd anon-credentials
```

Build:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Run tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

(Optional) Run examples if the repo includes an `examples/` directory:

```bash
cargo run --example basic_issue_and_prove
```

## Examples

Below is a high-level, illustrative flow. Consult the `examples/` folder or API docs for real code matching the repository's public interfaces.

### High-level flow

1. Issuer generates a keypair and publishes the public parameters.
2. Holder constructs a credential request (possibly with blinded attributes).
3. Issuer issues a credential (signed) to the holder.
4. Holder stores the credential securely.
5. When required, the Holder derives a Presentation that proves a predicate (e.g., age &gt;= 18) without revealing other attributes.
6. Verifier checks the Presentation against the Issuer's public parameters and requested predicates.

### Minimal code examples

Note: Replace functions/types with those exposed by the crate.

Issuance:

```rust
// issuer.rs (illustrative)
let issuer = Issuer::new();
let public_params = issuer.public_parameters();

// Holder creates a blinded request:
let holder = Holder::new();
let cred_req = holder.create_credential_request(&public_params, attributes);

// Issuer issues credential:
let credential = issuer.issue(cred_req, &attributes);
holder.store_credential(credential);
```

Proving to a verifier:

```rust
// holder.rs (illustrative)
let proof = holder.create_presentation(&public_params, &presentation_spec);

// verifier.rs (illustrative)
let verifier = Verifier::new();
let ok = verifier.verify_presentation(&public_params, &proof, &presentation_spec);
assert!(ok);
```

## Testing

Run the complete test-suite:

```bash
cargo test --all-features
```

For integration or example tests (if provided):

```bash
cargo test --test integration_tests
```

If building for WASM, use wasm-bindgen and wasm-pack in CI as appropriate.

## Security considerations

- Cryptography is hard: treat the library as experimental until audited.
- Do not use this crate in production environments without a formal review/audit.
- Carefully manage secrets (private keys, stored credentials). Use platform-appropriate secrets storage.
- Be wary of side-channels and metadata leakage (timing, sizes, correlation).
- Keep up-to-date with dependency updates and crypto primitives.

## Roadmap

Planned items:
- Add more predicate types (range proofs, set membership)
- Support for multiple signature/ZK schemes (pluggable backends)
- WASM packaging with examples for browser-based holders
- FFI bindings for other languages (e.g., Node, Python)
- Formal specification and test vectors

Contributions and PRs shaping the roadmap are welcome.
